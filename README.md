# Calibrated Projection in MATLAB: User's Manual and Package

We present the calibrated-projection MATLAB package implementing the method to construct confidence intervals proposed of **Kaido, Molinari, and Stoye "Confidence Intervals for Projections of Partially Identified Parameters"**, forthcoming at **Econometrica**. This version of the code is what was used to carry out the empirical application in Section 4 of Kaido, Molinari, and Stoye (2019) and the Monte Carlo simulations in Appendix C. Please visit https://molinari.economics.cornell.edu/programs.html for the most up-to-date version of the code.

# Getting Started

The file **calibrated-projection-MATLAB/Manual/KMST_Manual.pdf** provides details  on how to use the package for inference on projections of partially identified parameters and instructions on how to replicate the empirical application and simulation results in the paper.
